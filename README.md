# FYS-STK4155 Applied Data Analysis and Machine Learning
This repository contains my reports and source code for each of the three projects in the course FYS4150 Computational Physics given at University of Oslo (UiO) in the fall of 2020. From [UiO's description of the course](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/fys/FYS-STK4155/index-eng.html):

*The course introduces a variety of central algorithms and methods essential for studies of data analysis and machine learning. The course is project based and through the various projects, the students will be exposed to fundamental research problems in these fields, with the aim to reproduce state of the art scientific results. The students will learn to develop and structure large codes for studying these systems, get acquainted with computing facilities and learn to handle large scientific projects.*

The final grade in the course was given based on the projects listed below. Many of the ML methods are implemented from scratch, and in all cases the reports thoroughly review the mathematical background of the methods and put them into the context of the report. All code and graphics are created with Python using NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib and some Keras/Tensorflow. 
* [Project 1](https://github.com/fonstelien/FYS-STK4155/blob/master/project1/project1.pdf): *An Assessment of OLS, Ridge, and LASSO Regression on Areally Distributed Data* (score 92/100)

    We look at the performance of each of the linear regression methods using *n*th degree polynomials in two variables. We first look at data points generated by the *Franke function*, then on "real" data sampled from the height above sealevel of a mountain range.

* [Project 2](https://github.com/fonstelien/FYS-STK4155/blob/master/project2/report/project2.pdf): *A Study of Stochastic Gradient Descent and its Applications Linear and Logistic Regression Methods and Feed-Forward Neural Networks* (score 95/100)

    From-scratch implementation of stochastic gradient descent, logistic regression and a feed-forward neural network. We test the models on popular datasets like [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) and Wisconsin Breast Cancer.

* [Project 3](https://github.com/fonstelien/FYS-STK4155/blob/master/project3/report/project3.pdf): *Creating a Power Transformer Cooling System Model using Autoregression and Recurrent Neural Networks* (score 97/100)
    
    ML methods for time series to create a "digital twin" of a transformer cooling system. An investigation of two models for predicting the temperature of a transformer in dynamic loading conditions, based on readily-available measurements of current and cooling system operation status. Autoregression is implemented from scratch, but for the RNN I have used the Keras API.
