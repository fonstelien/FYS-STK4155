## FYS-STK4155 Project 1 H20
You will find my source code in the `*.py` files. They are arranged such that the `utils.py` file contains all the common stuff for importing packages, creating matrices, evaluating MSE, R$^2$ etc. In the other files, `ols.py`, `ridge.py` and `lasso.py`, you will find the methods I have made for running each of the algorithms.

I have used `jupyter lab` extensively in this work, during the code development process and for generating plots of my results. Scripting `plt` will never be beautiful, so please don't look too carefully. If you want to run some code for yourself, I have added a `conda` environment file here for you. Not what you asked for in that piazza post, but you cna install it by running
```
$ conda env create -f fys-stk4155.yml
```
